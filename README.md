# 📈 Marketing Campaign Effectiveness Analysis (A/B Testing)

This project analyzes the **effectiveness of marketing campaigns** using A/B testing and statistical modeling to evaluate conversion rates and ROI improvements.  
The goal is to determine which marketing strategy performs better and to optimize future targeting for improved business outcomes.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To measure and compare the performance of two or more marketing campaigns using data-driven A/B testing and statistical analysis — providing insights into conversions, ROI, and user engagement.

## 🧠 Project Overview

- **Analyzed campaign effectiveness** in driving conversions and ROI.  
- **Extracted and cleaned data** using **MySQL**.  
- **Performed A/B testing** with:
  - Hypothesis Testing  
  - Chi-square Test  
  - Logistic Regression (Python)  
- **Visualized outcomes** using a **Power BI Dashboard** for clear interpretation.  
- **Result:** Achieved a **9.3% rise in conversions** and a **12% uplift in ROI** through improved targeting accuracy.
